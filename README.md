#  Ferrite
Ferrite is a in-development code editor made to be lightweight & portable.<br/>
This will be supported on multiple how ever development is focused on Windows 10/11 for now.<br/>


##  Why Ferrite?
Code Editors like Visual Studio Code usually use Electron which by itself is really heavy.<br/>
This isn't bad but it could have a ton of room for improvement imo.<br/>


I still will use Web however instead of Electron, I'm going to implement the Editor with Ultralight!<br/>


##  Why CPP?
People might look at this and say why CPP over Rust or Carbon (ðŸ¤”)<br/>

CPP isn't obsolete yet and it probably won't be for quite a bit especially because how widely used it is.<br/>

For most of my time that I've spent developing it's all been game hacking which mostly has been done in CPP, and I want to use CPP til it dies out.<br/>


##  Extensions
Extensions is something I want to integrate in the future how ever it'll be a lengthy process obviously.<br/>

I want to use Luau, WASM or another scripting language obviously for performance & ease of use.<br/>


##  Contributions
Contributions are fine but be aware this might take like a few months to get a stable build.<br/>



##  Libraries Used
**Ultralight**: Insanely fast HTML Render made with a WebKit fork<br/>
