# Ferrite
Ferrite is a new generation code editor made to be lightweight & portable.


## Why Ferrite
Many editors rely on Electron which is perfectly fine, how ever there is many alternatives to Electron such as Tauri, NW.js, and what ever else.</br>

I decided to use WebView as it's directly intergrated into Windows 10/11 and is usable on macOS and Linux</br>
WebView also supports C++ bindings (and I use C++, like a lot) which is good for this as I'll probably use it a lot.</br>


## Extensions
I'll make support for extensions in the future, maybe I'll create a scripting engine with Luau or Alternative Languages.</br>
This also means there will be a documentation for extensions.</br>


## Building
Building will be soon with cmake & visual studio.</br>
